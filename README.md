## Background
We let patients SMS measurements into Chirp and everything is working OK until
we get to unrecognized messages. So long as we can identify a patient we send
out a generic and unhelpful text message in response to unrecognized input.

What we should do instead is provide a sort of help menu that can recognize a
few commands and respond appropriately. Here are some input and output examples:

| INPUT | OUTPUT |
| ----- | ------ |
“help” | “For help with blood pressure, text ‘help bp’, for help with weight, type ‘help weight’, for help with fasting glucose, type ‘help fgc’”
“help bp” | “To enter blood pressure, text ‘bp ###/##’”
“help fgc” | “To enter fasting glucose, text ‘fgc ###’”
“help wt” | “To enter weight, text ‘wt ###.#’”
“help [gibberish]” | Long form help text from above
“[gibberish]” | Long form help text from above

## Code entry point

```ruby
module Api
  module Measurements::V1
    class TextMeasurementsController < ApiController
      skip_before_filter :authorize_api

      def create
        patient        = FindPatientFromText.new(message.from)
        tokenized_text = TextBodyTokenizer.new(message.body)
        measurement    = MeasurementFromTextFactory.from_text(tokenized_text, patient)
        status         = measurement.save

        send_response_text(status.response)

        render nothing: true
      rescue
        if patient.patient
          # v---- Our code will replace the code below ----------v
          text = <<-TXT.gsub(/^ {8}/, '')
          Sorry! I didn't recognize that. You can submit fasting glucose like this:
          fgc 50
          Or weight like this:
          wt 180.2
          TXT
          # ^----------------------------------------------------^
          send_response_text(text)
        end
        render nothing: true
      end

      private

      def send_response_text(body)
        TwilioMessage.create(
          from: from_number,
          to: message.from,
          body: body)
      end

      def from_number
        TwilioConfiguration.number(:measurements)
      end

      def message
        @message ||= TwilioMessage.get(params['MessageSid'])
      end
    end
  end
end
```
